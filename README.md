The Archive Walker Software is an offline tool to read and examine phasor measurement unit (PMU) data to detect events and conditions for further analysis.  The underlying engine is written in MATLAB, with the GUI written in Visual Basic and Visual C#, with the underlying engine included via the MATLAB runtime toolbox.

The Archive Walker Software GUI is compatible with Microsoft Windows and requires the MathWorks MATLAB R2018a (9.4) runtime binaries, along with the Microsoft .NET framework 4.6.1 or higher, installed.  The underlying MATLAB code should be platform agnostic, but has only been tested in the Microsoft Windows environment.  Please see the Wiki for information on installing the pre-requisite software packages.

Portions of this software were developed with funding from the Bonneville Power Administration, under the Technology Innovations program (TIP-350).  Current development is funded by the Department of Energy, Office of Electricity.
