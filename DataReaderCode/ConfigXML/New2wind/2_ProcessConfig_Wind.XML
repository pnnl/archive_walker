        For interpolation, filtering, and sampling-rate conversion, if the 
        PMU element is omitted the process is applied to all signals in all
        PMUs. If the Channels element within a PMU element is omitted the 
        process is applied to all signals in that PMU. Otherwise, the 
        process is applied to the specific PMUs and signals listed in the
        elements.
        If channels are not specified for wrap and unwrap operations, they
        are applied to all angle signals in the PMUs.
